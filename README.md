The purpose of this program is to model NFL Combine data using a structured Player class and create a Python object for each player in the dataset. It converts raw CSV data into well-defined objects that are easier to analyze and reuse in later programs.
The program takes a CSV file containing combine information as input and parses each row into a Player object using a dataclass with clearly defined attributes (such as name, college, height, weight, and combine metrics). The output is a list of Player objects, and the program prints a summary and sample player objects to verify successful creation.
The program is run as a Python script that reads the CSV file with csv.DictReader, cleans and converts data using helper functions, and initializes Player objects through a class method. The load_players function orchestrates object creation, while the main block loads the data and displays results, demonstrating object-oriented design and data parsing in practice.
